Backend:

- Java: Core programming language for server-side logic and business logic implementation.
- Spring Boot: building RESTful APIs and managing application components.
- Hibernate: Acts as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, facilitating communication between Java objects and the PostgreSQL database.
- PostgreSQL: Reliable relational database management system for storing and managing data persistently(components,price history,user data).
- Rest API: Enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating data exchange and processing.
  
Frontend:

- HTML: Structures the user interface and defines the content and layout of web pages.
- Thymeleaf: Dynamically renders HTML templates, integrating with Spring Boot for server-side rendering.
- CSS: Styles the web pages, controlling the visual appearance and layout of the frontend.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the user interface, allowing real-time updates and asynchronous communication with the backend.
